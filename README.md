# KMeans Clustering on Life Expectancy Data

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of the **KMeans Clustering** algorithm on a dataset obtained from **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)**, containing data on life expectancy across various cities in Turkey. The task is to segment the data based on cities and gender to identify clusters with similar life expectancy patterns.

## Project Contents
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes life expectancy data across different cities in Turkey, segmented by gender.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for clustering.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of the **KMeans Clustering** algorithm to segment the data into clusters based on life expectancy.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation using metrics such as **Inertia** and **Silhouette Score** to assess the clustering quality.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KMeans-Life-Expectancy.git
